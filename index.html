        <h3>DBMS </h3>
        <p>
            A Database Management System (DBMS) is software that enables users to create, manage, and manipulate databases. DBMS provides an interface for users and applications to interact with databases, facilitating data storage, retrieval, update, and deletion, while ensuring data integrity, security, and consistency. Common examples of DBMS include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.</p>

        <h3>ADVANTAGE OF DBMS</h3>
        <P>
            DBMS has a wide variety of advantages that make it very desirable for a myriad of companies. These include:

            1. Improved data security
            Data security measures are very important for any organization. To ensure high data security, companies use
            DBMS as it provides various levels of security authentication which can be done at the user and admin
            levels. This helps to avoid security breaches and takes care of the security issues.

            2. Data retrieval
            DBMS provides a platform that is time-saving and easy to use for organizations. Data can be stored and
            retrieved quickly and securely within time constraints.

            3. Minimum data inconsistency
            Data inconsistency occurs when there are different versions of the same data stored at different places. For
            example, data inconsistency exists when let’s say a school’s database has the name of the Principal as
            'Raman Desai' at one place and it’s 'Naman Desai' at the other place. Here, there’s an inconsistency as the
            principal is the same and it should be the same at all places in a database. Such errors are highly
            minimized in a properly designed DBMS.

            4. Improved decision making
            DBMS provides high data quality by minimizing data inconsistency and improving data security. This ensures
            that there are fewer errors and high accuracy rate is maintained. Thus, DBMS helps businesses to improve
            upon their decisions that are backed by the data in a DBMS.

            5. Better data sharing facility
            DBMS ensures that database users have access to the data. They can see the data and the changes happening in
            that data. Then, the end-users can also respond quickly to such updates in the database.

            6. Improved data integration
            DBMS gives companies an integrated view of their organization’s operations and departments. It helps
            companies to see how one segment of their company is affecting the other one.

            7. Good data back-up
            Imagine yourself working on an important task, and suddenly the system crashes. How would you feel?
            Obviously, you’ll get angry and irritated. In the case of organizations, they can’t afford such errors. So,
            in such cases, DBMS comes to their rescue by enabling data recovery and backup.
        </P>
        <H3>DISADVANTAGE OF DBMS</H3>
        <P>
            Apart from the advantages, there are a few demerits of using DBMS. Let’s have a look at some of the
            important ones:

            1. DBMS is expensive
            DBMS requires highly professional staff, sophisticated hardware and software that makes it quite expensive
            to implement and maintain. Also, training costs for staff and licensing costs are significant ones that add
            to the total cost of DBMS operations. Thus, heavy investment in database technology results in DBMS being
            expensive.

            2. Complexity issues
            DBMS is very complex to operate and manage. It requires skilled personnel to maintain, so it’s difficult for
            non-technical people to understand its working. If one doesn’t use DBMS properly, then there can be system
            failure issues. These issues can lead to database failure or data loss.

            3. Not beneficial for small firms
            DBMS is designed to be useful for large organizations. Generally, traditional file systems work better for
            small-scale firms as compared to DBMS. This is because the performance of DBMS is slow for small firms.
            Also, it’s quite expensive for them to use DBMS.

            4. Frequent upgrade issue
            As updates occur in a system, new features are added to its functionality. This makes it necessary for staff
            to learn about these software and hardware upgrades. As in today’s world, changes occur rapidly, so it takes
            time, effort, and cost for organizations to train their staff.

        <h3>COMPONENTS OF DBMS</h3>
        <p>
            There are many components available in the DBMS. Each component has a significant task in the DBMS. A
            database environment is a collection of components that regulates the use of data, management, and a group
            of data. These components consist of people, the technique of Handel the database, data, hardware, software,
            etc. there are several components available for the DBMS. We are going to explain five main topics of the
            database below.

            Components of DBMS
            1. Hardware
            Here the hardware means the physical part of the DBMS. Here the hardware includes output devices like a
            printer, monitor, etc., and storage devices like a hard disk.
            In DBMS, information hardware is the most important visible part. The equipment which is used for the
            visibility of the data is the printer, computer, scanner, etc. This equipment is used to capture the data
            and present the output to the user.
            With the help of hardware, the DBMS can access and update the database.
            The server can store a large amount of data, which can be shared with the help of the user's own system.
            The database can be run in any system that ranges from microcomputers to mainframe computers. And this
            database also provides an interface between the real worlds to the database.
            When we try to run any database software like MySQL, we can type any commands with the help of our
            keyboards, and RAM, ROM, and processor are part of our computer system.
            2. Software
            Software is the main component of the DBMS.
            Software is defined as the collection of programs that are used to instruct the computer about its work. The
            software consists of a set of procedures, programs, and routines associated with the computer system's
            operation and performance. Also, we can say that computer software is a set of instructions that is used to
            instruct the computer hardware for the operation of the computers.
            The software includes so many software like network software and operating software. The database software
            is used to access the database, and the database application performs the task.
            This software has the ability to understand the database accessing language and then convert these languages
            to real database commands and then execute the database.
            This is the main component as the total database operation works on a software or application. We can also
            be called as database software the wrapper of the whole physical database, which provides an easy interface
            for the user to store, update and delete the data from the database.
            Some examples of DBMS software include MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, dBase, FileMaker, Clipper, Foxpro,
            Microsoft Access, etc.
            3. Data
            The term data means the collection of any raw fact stored in the database. Here the data are any type of raw
            material from which meaningful information is generated.
            The database can store any form of data, such as structural data, non-structural data, and logical data.
            The structured data are highly specific in the database and have a structured format. But in the case of
            non-structural data, it is a collection of different types of data, and these data are stored in their
            native format.
            We also call the database the structure of the DBMS. With the help of the database, we can create and
            construct the DBMS. After the creation of the database, we can create, access, and update that database.
            The main reason behind discovering the database is to create and manage the data within the database.
            Data is the most important part of the DBMS. Here the database contains the actual data and metadata. Here
            metadata means data about data.
            For example, when the user stores the data in a database, some data, such as the size of the data, the name
            of the data, and some data related to the user, are stored within the database. These data are called
            metadata.
            4. Procedures
            The procedure is a type of general instruction or guidelines for the use of DBMS. This instruction includes
            how to set up the database, how to install the database, how to log in and log out of the database, how to
            manage the database, how to take a backup of the database, and how to generate the report of the database.
            In DBMS, with the help of procedure, we can validate the data, control the access and reduce the traffic
            between the server and the clients. The DBMS can offer better performance to extensive or complex business
            logic when the user follows all the procedures correctly.
            The main purpose of the procedure is to guide the user during the management and operation of the database.
            The procedure of the databases is so similar to the function of the database. The major difference between
            the database procedure and database function is that the database function acts the same as the SQL
            statement. In contrast, the database procedure is invoked using the CALL statement of the DBMS.
            Database procedures can be created in two ways in enterprise architecture. These two ways are as below.
            The individual object or the default object.
            The operations in a container.
            CREATE [OR REPLACE] PROCEDURE procedure_name (<Argument> {IN, OUT, IN OUT}
                <Datatype>,...)
                    IS
                    Declaration section<variable, constant> ;
                        BEGIN
                        Execution section
                        EXCEPTION
                        Exception section
                        END
                        5. Database Access Language
                        Database Access Language is a simple language that allows users to write commands to perform the
                        desired operations on the data that is stored in the database.
                        Database Access Language is a language used to write commands to access, upsert, and delete data
                        stored in a database.
                        Users can write commands or query the database using Database Access Language before submitting
                        them to the database for execution.
                        Through utilizing the language, users can create new databases and tables, insert data and
                        delete data.
                        Examples of database languages are SQL (structured query language), My Access, Oracle, etc. A
                        database language is comprised of two languages.
                        1. Data Definition Language(DDL):It is used to construct a database. DDL implements database
                        schema at the physical, logical, and external levels.

        <h3>MODELS OF DBMS </h3>
        <p>
            A Data Model in Database Management System (DBMS) is the concept of tools that are developed to summarize
            the description of the database. Data Models provide us with a transparent picture of data which helps us in
            creating an actual database. It shows us from the design of the data to its proper implementation of data.

            Types of Relational Models
            Conceptual Data Model
            Representational Data Model
            Physical Data Model
            It is basically classified into 3 types:-

            Data Models in DBMS

            1. Conceptual Data Model
            The conceptual data model describes the database at a very high level and is useful to understand the needs
            or requirements of the database. It is this model, that is used in the requirement-gathering process i.e.
            before the Database Designers start making a particular database. One such popular model is the
            entity/relationship model (ER model). The E/R model specializes in entities, relationships, and even
            attributes that are used by database designers. In terms of this concept, a discussion can be made even with
            non-computer science(non-technical) users and stakeholders, and their requirements can be understood.

            Entity-Relationship Model( ER Model): It is a high-level data model which is used to define the data and the
            relationships between them. It is basically a conceptual design of any database which is easy to design the
            view of data.

            Components of ER Model:

            Entity: An entity is referred to as a real-world object. It can be a name, place, object, class, etc. These
            are represented by a rectangle in an ER Diagram.
            Attributes: An attribute can be defined as the description of the entity. These are represented by Ellipse
            in an ER Diagram. It can be Age, Roll Number, or Marks for a Student.
            Relationship: Relationships are used to define relations among different entities. Diamonds and Rhombus are
            used to show Relationships.
            Characteristics of a conceptual data model
            Offers Organization-wide coverage of the business concepts.
            This type of Data Models are designed and developed for a business audience.
            The conceptual model is developed independently of hardware specifications like data storage capacity,
            location or software specifications like DBMS vendor and technology. The focus is to represent data as a
            user will see it in the “real world.”
            Conceptual data models known as Domain models create a common vocabulary for all stakeholders by
            establishing basic concepts and scope

            2. Representational Data Model
            This type of data model is used to represent only the logical part of the database and does not represent
            the physical structure of the database. The representational data model allows us to focus primarily, on the
            design part of the database. A popular representational model is a Relational model. The relational Model
            consists of Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus. In the Relational Model, we basically use tables to
            represent our data and the relationships between them. It is a theoretical concept whose practical
            implementation is done in Physical Data Model.

            The advantage of using a Representational data model is to provide a foundation to form the base for the
            Physical model

            3. Physical Data Model
            The physical Data Model is used to practically implement Relational Data Model. Ultimately, all data in a
            database is stored physically on a secondary storage device such as discs and tapes. This is stored in the
            form of files, records, and certain other data structures. It has all the information on the format in which
            the files are present and the structure of the databases, the presence of external data structures, and
            their relation to each other. Here, we basically save tables in memory so they can be accessed efficiently.
            In order to come up with a good physical model, we have to work on the relational model in a better way.
            Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to practically implement Relational Algebra.

            This Data Model describes HOW the system will be implemented using a specific DBMS system. This model is
            typically created by DBA and developers. The purpose is actual implementation of the database.

            Characteristics of a physical data model:
            The physical data model describes data need for a single project or application though it maybe integrated
            with other physical data models based on project scope.
            Data Model contains relationships between tables that which addresses cardinality and nullability of the
            relationships.
            Developed for a specific version of a DBMS, location, data storage or technology to be used in the project.
            Columns should have exact datatypes, lengths assigned and default values.
            Primary and Foreign keys, views, indexes, access profiles, and authorizations, etc. are defined
            Data models provide a blueprint for organizing and structuring data within a database. From hierarchical
            models to relational models, each has its unique use case. To explore these models and their practical
            applications, the GATE CS Self-Paced Courseprovides detailed coverage on DBMS concepts, ensuring you’re
            well-prepared for your database-related exams.

            Some Other Data Models
            1. Hierarchical Model
            The hierarchical Model is one of the oldest models in the data model which was developed by IBM, in the
            1950s. In a hierarchical model, data are viewed as a collection of tables, or we can say segments that form
            a hierarchical relation. In this, the data is organized into a tree-like structure where each record
            consists of one parent record and many children. Even if the segments are connected as a chain-like
            structure by logical associations, then the instant structure can be a fan structure with multiple branches.
            We call the illogical associations as directional associations.

            2. Network Model
            The Network Model was formalized by the Database Task group in the 1960s. This model is the generalization
            of the hierarchical model. This model can consist of multiple parent segments and these segments are grouped
            as levels but there exists a logical association between the segments belonging to any level. Mostly, there
            exists a many-to-many logical association between any of the two segments.

    <div class="architecture">
        <h3>THREE LEVEL ARCHITECTURE </h3>
        <P>
            The 3-tier architecture is a commonly used architectural approach in Database Management Systems (DBMSs) for
            the design and development of applications that work with databases. The 3-tier architecture divides an
            application’s components into three tiers or layers. Each layer has its own set of responsibilities.

            DBMS 3-Tier architecture divides the complete system into three inter-related but independent modules as
            shown below:

            dbms-3tier
            DBMS 3-tier architecture

            Physical Level: At the physical level, the information about the location of database objects in the data
            store is kept. Various users of DBMS are unaware of the locations of these objects.In simple terms,physical
            level of a database describes how the data is being stored in secondary storage devices like disks and tapes
            and also gives insights on additional storage details.
            Conceptual Level: At conceptual level, data is represented in the form of various database tables. For
            Example, STUDENT database may contain STUDENT and COURSE tables which will be visible to users but users are
            unaware of their storage.Also referred as logical schema,it describes what kind of data is to be stored in
            the database.
            External Level: An external level specifies a view of the data in terms of conceptual level tables. Each
            external level view is used to cater to the needs of a particular category of users. For Example, FACULTY of
            a university is interested in looking course details of students, STUDENTS are interested in looking at all
            details related to academics, accounts, courses and hostel details as well. So, different views can be
            generated for different users. The main focus of external level is data abstraction.
        </P>

    <div class="keys" id="key">
        <h3> KEYS IN DBMS </h3>
        <p>
            Keys are one of the basic requirements of a relational database model. It is widely used to identify the
            tuples(rows) uniquely in the table. We also use keys to set up relations amongst various columns and tables
            of a relational database.

            Different Types of Database Keys
            Candidate Key
            Primary Key
            Super Key
            Alternate Key
            Foreign Key
            Composite Key
            To master the concepts of keys and other essential topics in databases, consider enrolling in the GATE CS
            Self-Paced course . This course provides in-depth coverage of core subjects, helping you build a strong
            foundation for GATE and other competitive exams, while enhancing your understanding of critical computer
            science principles.

            Candidate Key
            The minimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple is known as a candidate key. For Example,
            STUD_NO in STUDENT relation.

            It is a minimal super key.
            It is a super key with no repeated data is called a candidate key.
            The minimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify a record.
            It must contain unique values.
            It can contain NULL values.
            Every table must have at least a single candidate key.
            A table can have multiple candidate keys but only one primary key.
            The value of the Candidate Key is unique and may be null for a tuple.
            There can be more than one candidate key in a relationship.
            Example:

            STUD_NO is the candidate key for relation STUDENT.
            Table STUDENT

            STUD_NO SNAME ADDRESS PHONE
            1 Shyam Delhi 123456789
            2 Rakesh Kolkata 223365796
            3 Suraj Delhi 175468965
            The candidate key can be simple (having only one attribute) or composite as well.
            Example:

            {STUD_NO, COURSE_NO} is a composite
            candidate key for relation STUDENT_COURSE.
            Table STUDENT_COURSE

            STUD_NO TEACHER_NO COURSE_NO
            1 001 C001
            2 056 C005
            Note: In SQL Server a unique constraint that has a nullable column, allows the value ‘ null ‘ in that column
            only once . That’s why the STUD_PHONE attribute is a candidate here, but can not be a ‘null’ value in the
            primary key attribute.

            Primary Key
            There can be more than one candidate key in relation out of which one can be chosen as the primary key. For
            Example, STUD_NO, as well as STUD_PHONE, are candidate keys for relation STUDENT but STUD_NO can be chosen
            as the primary key (only one out of many candidate keys).

            It is a unique key.
            It can identify only one tuple (a record) at a time.
            It has no duplicate values, it has unique values.
            It cannot be NULL.
            Primary keys are not necessarily to be a single column; more than one column can also be a primary key for a
            table.
            Example:

            STUDENT table -> Student(STUD_NO, SNAME,
            ADDRESS, PHONE) , STUD_NO is a primary key
            Table STUDENT

            STUD_NO SNAME ADDRESS PHONE
            1 Shyam Delhi 123456789
            2 Rakesh Kolkata 223365796
            3 Suraj Delhi 175468965
            Super Key
            The set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple is known as Super Key. For Example, STUD_NO,
            (STUD_NO, STUD_NAME), etc. A super key is a group of single or multiple keys that identifies rows in a
            table. It supports NULL values.

            Adding zero or more attributes to the candidate key generates the super key.
            A candidate key is a super key but vice versa is not true.
            Super Key values may also be NULL.
            Example:

            Consider the table shown above.
            STUD_NO+PHONE is a super key.
            Relation between Primary Key, Candidate Key and Super Key
            Relation between Primary Key, Candidate Key, and Super Key

            Alternate Key
            The candidate key other than the primary key is called an alternate key .

            All the keys which are not primary keys are called alternate keys.
            Foreign Key
            If an attribute can only take the values which are present as values of some other attribute, it will be a
            foreign key to the attribute to which it refers. The relation which is being referenced is called referenced
            relation and the corresponding attribute is called referenced attribute. The referenced attribute of the
            referenced relation should be the primary key to it.

            It is a key it acts as a primary key in one table and it acts as
            secondary key in another table.
            It combines two or more relations (tables) at a time.
            They act as a cross-reference between the tables.
            For example, DNO is a primary key in the DEPT table and a non-key in EMP
            Example:

            Refer Table STUDENT shown above.
            STUD_NO in STUDENT_COURSE is a
            foreign key to STUD_NO in STUDENT relation.
            Table STUDENT_COURSE

            STUD_NO TEACHER_NO COURSE_NO
            1 005 C001
            2 056 C005
            It may be worth noting that, unlike the Primary Key of any given relation, Foreign Key can be NULL as well
            as may contain duplicate tuples i.e. it need not follow uniqueness constraint. For Example, STUD_NO in the
            STUDENT_COURSE relation is not unique. It has been repeated for the first and third tuples. However, the
            STUD_NO in STUDENT relation is a primary key and it needs to be always unique, and it cannot be null.

            Relation between Primary Key and Foreign Key

            Composite Key
            Sometimes, a table might not have a single column/attribute that uniquely identifies all the records of a
            table. To uniquely identify rows of a table, a combination of two or more columns/attributes can be used. It
            still can give duplicate values in rare cases. So, we need to find the optimal set of attributes that can
            uniquely identify rows in a table.

            It acts as a primary key if there is no primary key in a table
            Two or more attributes are used together to make a composite key .
            Different combinations of attributes may give different accuracy in terms of identifying the rows uniquely.
            Example:

            FULLNAME + DOB can be combined
            together to access the details of a student.

        <h3>NORMALIZATION </h3>
        <P>Normalization is the process of minimizing redundancy from a relation or set of relations. Redundancy in
            relation may cause insertion, deletion, and update anomalies. So, it helps to minimize the redundancy in
            relations. Normal forms are used to eliminate or reduce redundancy in database tables.

            Normalization of DBMS
            In database management systems (DBMS), normal forms are a series of guidelines that help to ensure that the
            design of a database is efficient, organized, and free from data anomalies. There are several levels of
            normalization, each with its own set of guidelines, known as normal forms.

            Important Points Regarding Normal Forms in DBMS
            First Normal Form (1NF): This is the most basic level of normalization. In 1NF, each table cell should
            contain only a single value, and each column should have a unique name. The first normal form helps to
            eliminate duplicate data and simplify queries.
            Second Normal Form (2NF): 2NF eliminates redundant data by requiring that each non-key attribute be
            dependent on the primary key. This means that each column should be directly related to the primary key, and
            not to other columns.
            Third Normal Form (3NF): 3NF builds on 2NF by requiring that all non-key attributes are independent of each
            other. This means that each column should be directly related to the primary key, and not to any other
            columns in the same table.
            Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF): BCNF is a stricter form of 3NF that ensures that each determinant in a table
            is a candidate key. In other words, BCNF ensures that each non-key attribute is dependent only on the
            candidate key.
            Fourth Normal Form (4NF): 4NF is a further refinement of BCNF that ensures that a table does not contain any
            multi-valued dependencies.
            Fifth Normal Form (5NF): 5NF is the highest level of normalization and involves decomposing a table into
            smaller tables to remove data redundancy and improve data integrity.
        </P>
        <br>
        <h3> ADVANTAGE OF NORMALIZATION</h3>
        <p>Reduced data redundancy: Normalization helps to eliminate duplicate data in tables, reducing the amount of
            storage space needed and improving database efficiency.
            Improved data consistency: Normalization ensures that data is stored in a consistent and organized manner,
            reducing the risk of data inconsistencies and errors.
            Simplified database design: Normalization provides guidelines for organizing tables and data relationships,
            making it easier to design and maintain a database.
            Improved query performance: Normalized tables are typically easier to search and retrieve data from,
            resulting in faster query performance.
            Easier database maintenance: Normalization reduces the complexity of a database by breaking it down into
            smaller, more manageable tables, making it easier to add, modify, and delete data.
            Overall, using normal forms in DBMS helps to improve data quality, increase database efficiency, and
            simplify database design and maintenance.
        </p>
        <h3>DISADVANTAGE OF NORMALIZATION</h3>
        <p>
            More tables to join as by spreading out information into more tables, the need to join table’s increments
            and the undertaking turns out to be more dreary. The information base gets more enthusiastically to
            acknowledge too.
            Tables will contain codes as opposed to genuine information as the rehashed information will be put away as
            lines of codes instead of the genuine information. Thusly, there is consistently a need to go to the query
            table.
            Data model turns out to be incredibly hard to question against as the information model is advanced for
            applications, not for impromptu questioning. (Impromptu question is an inquiry that can’t be resolved before
            the issuance of the question. It comprises of a SQL that is developed progressively and is typically built
            by work area cordial question devices.). Subsequently it is difficult to display the information base
            without understanding what the client wants.
            As the typical structure type advances, the exhibition turns out to be increasingly slow.
            Proper information is needed on the different ordinary structures to execute the standardization cycle
            effectively. Reckless use may prompt awful plan loaded up with significant peculiarities and information
            irregularity.
            Increased complexity: Normalization can increase the complexity of a database design, especially if the data
            model is not well understood or if the normalization process is not carried out correctly. This can lead to
            difficulty in maintaining and updating the database over time.
            Reduced flexibility: Normalization can limit the flexibility of a database, as it requires data to be
            organized in a specific way. This can make it difficult to accommodate changes in the data or to create new
            reports or applications that require different data structures.
            Increased storage requirements: Normalization can increase the storage requirements of a database, as it may
            require more tables and additional join operations to access the data. This can also increase the complexity
            and cost of the hardware required to support the database.
